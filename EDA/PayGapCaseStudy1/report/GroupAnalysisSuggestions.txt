I have tried to combine our R markdown documents.  These are the changes I am proposing, I have merged in suggestions 1-3,
and not changed anything regarding section 4 - 5:

1. There is an error in what the tutor is doing, he's joining on Employer name but the names are not consistent.
Hence the data only has 321 rows in it and should have at least 89 * 4=356 rows.
I spent quite a bit of time verifying the data in my results are correct, I've included my code and changed it to fit in
with the variable naming convention chosen and have done the least number of modifications possible. I've also changed all my variables
to be consistent with the format within the document.

2. I have added the data sources section at the bottom

3. I have added section headings to help in the IDE after r declaration, i.e: ``` {r sectionheader, options...
which the tutor suggested doing - allows you to jump to a section in the IDE.

4. I think we should remove the word and pdf output one requires word to be installed I believe and the other required
LaTeX to be installed (which I have) but also set up with knitr.

5. I know the tutor does this in his examples but we are using heading 1 for sub headings by only having a single #
the title is output as heading 1, my suggestion would be to make the sub headings use ## or greater depending on
heading depth.
